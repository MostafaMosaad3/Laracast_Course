<p> A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence.
    A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s thesis statement;
    it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader of
    the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few
    sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often
    best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph
